# My Emacs configuration files, for your viewing pleasure.

## Philosophy
I have considered a number of configurations for Emacs, starting from a bare-bones download, spacemacs, and now, doom-emacs. I have settled uneasily at the latter because I found so much of the legwork was done for me by doom, while there was still enough extensibility to suit my needs. However, I have noticed performance issues as of late, and will be making changes.

## Features
I don't need Emacs for every task, but when I need it it needs to be reliable, easily modifiable, and extensible. Currently, I use it for three main purposes:
1. As a C/Objective C editor
2. For taking notes on papers and books
3. For ORG-roam zettelkasten notes.

The latter two are what have given me such a headache. Since I want to store all my notes somewhere they're always available (currently Dropbox), and since I use Zotero for bibliographies, my setup needs to account for a lot of moving parts. I need to be able to open and annotate files that are in a shared folder, and then attach those annotations to my ORG-roam dump. There is CHMODing to do if you want to replicate this...
